# ASTROpay Rust Backend

This service is the beginning of the backend migration out of Next.js route handlers.

What it currently owns:

- merchant registration, login, logout, and cookie-backed sessions
- invoice creation, listing, detail lookup, and status lookup
- Horizon-backed reconciliation for pending invoices
- webhook-driven payment marking (`/api/webhooks/stellar`)
- a Rust migration runner that reuses the existing SQL migrations

Reconciliation and the Stellar webhook validate each merchant `settlement_public_key` with Stellar strkey decoding before inserting into `payouts`. Invalid keys skip payout queueing (invoice still marked paid) and emit a `payment_events` row with `event_type = payout_skipped_invalid_destination`. Run `cargo test` for strkey coverage.

What is intentionally not faked yet:

- buyer XDR generation/submission for checkout
- merchant settlement cron

Those routes return `501 Not Implemented` in the Rust service until the Stellar transaction logic is ported properly.

## Merchant registration and wallet keys

`POST /api/auth/register` trims `stellar_public_key` and `settlement_public_key` before storage. Registration returns **409 Conflict** if either incoming key already appears on **any** existing merchant in **either** column (same rule for both keys so a key cannot be “shared” as someone else’s business wallet or settlement wallet). That prevents ambiguous ownership of payouts and identity.

Apply migration `002_merchant_wallet_key_indexes.sql` (via `cargo run --bin migrate`) so those lookups stay fast as the merchant table grows.

**Verify:** `cargo test wallet_conflict` (pure logic). With Postgres running, register a merchant, then register again with the same stellar or settlement key (or swap roles) and expect **409** with the conflict message.
## HTTP 401 (authentication) JSON contract

All **401 Unauthorized** responses use a single structured shape so clients can branch on `error.code` instead of parsing free-form strings:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "AUTH_INVALID_CREDENTIALS",
    "message": "Invalid credentials"
  }
}
```

Stable `code` values (do not depend on `message` for logic):

| `code` | When |
| --- | --- |
| `AUTH_INVALID_CREDENTIALS` | Login rejected (unknown email or wrong password; same response for both). |
| `AUTH_SESSION_REQUIRED` | Cookie session missing, invalid, expired, or not accepted for the route (e.g. `/api/auth/me`, invoice routes). |
| `AUTH_CRON_SECRET_MISMATCH` | `Authorization: Bearer …` does not match `CRON_SECRET` for cron/webhook routes. |

Other HTTP errors (400, 404, 409, 501, 500) still use the legacy form `{ "error": "<string>" }` until migrated.

**Quick check:** with the server running, `curl -s -o /dev/stderr -w "%{http_code}" http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/auth/me` should print `401` and a JSON body whose `error.code` is `AUTH_SESSION_REQUIRED`.
## Cron run audit (`cron_runs`)

Migration `004_cron_runs.sql` adds an append-only table keyed by `job_type` (`reconcile` \| `settle`) with JSONB `metadata` (response-shaped summary: `scanned` / `results` or `processed` / `results`) and optional `error_detail`. Successful Rust reconcile runs insert a row (if the handler returns `Ok` after scanning; Horizon or DB errors before that point skip audit persistence). Settle (still not implemented) inserts `success = false` with the error text before returning `501`. Audit insert failures are logged and do not change the HTTP status.

**Verification:** `cargo test` checks that `004_cron_runs.sql` defines the table and index; apply migrations with `cargo run --bin migrate` before relying on audit rows in development.
## Database migrations

SQL lives in `../usdc-payment-link-tool/migrations/`. Apply with `cargo run --bin migrate` from `rust-backend/`. The runner errors clearly if the migrations directory is missing or if a file’s SQL fails.

**Invoice `metadata` (JSONB):** migration `003_invoice_metadata_jsonb_index_plan.sql` records the indexing policy—no speculative GIN until real filter queries exist—and sets `COMMENT ON COLUMN invoices.metadata` for DB catalog visibility. See the Next.js README for the same guidance.

**Verification:** `cargo test` (includes a guard that 003 stays comment/plan-only without `CREATE INDEX`).
SQL lives in `../usdc-payment-link-tool/migrations/`. Apply in lexical order with:

```bash
cd rust-backend
cargo run --bin migrate
```

The runner aborts with a clear error if that directory is missing (for example when not run from `rust-backend/`) or if a migration file fails.

### `sessions` indexes

- **Request path**: Session validation loads the row by `sessions.id` (JWT `sid`); the primary key is the right index.
- **Cleanup path**: For jobs that delete or archive rows with `WHERE expires_at < $cutoff`, use migration `002_session_expiry_indexes.sql`, which builds `(expires_at, id)` for ordered batches and `(merchant_id, expires_at)` for merchant-scoped work. The composite on `merchant_id` replaces the standalone `merchant_id` index from `001_init.sql` after migration 002 runs.

**Verification:** `cargo test` (includes a guard that migration 002 defines the expected index names). With Postgres available, run `migrate` then inspect indexes, for example `psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c '\d sessions'`.

## Run locally

```bash
cd rust-backend
cargo run --bin migrate
cargo run
```

The service reads env vars from:

- `rust-backend/.env.local`
- `rust-backend/.env`
- `../usdc-payment-link-tool/.env.local`
- `../usdc-payment-link-tool/.env`
